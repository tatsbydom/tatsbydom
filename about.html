      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m an independent tattoo artist based in Jacksonville, FL, working outside of a traditional tattoo shop setting. With two years of self-taught experience, I’ve had the privilege of working with a variety of clients and creating unique designs tailored to their individual styles. My artistic style leans toward realism, and I’m passionate about bringing lifelike images to the skin. I can also do designs with intricate line work and am happy to take on designs that incorporate these elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continue to develop my craft, I’m offering my tattoos at a discounted rate to make quality work accessible while I build my portfolio and grow professionally.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Hygiene and Safety</h2>
      <p>
        Client safety is my top priority. I follow strict hygiene protocols, including the use of single-use needles and disposable equipment, and I thoroughly sanitize my workspace before and after each session. All materials are either sterile and single-use or professionally disinfected according to industry standards. I strive to maintain a clean, safe, and comfortable environment for every client.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Booking and Process</h2>
      <p>
        Clients can book appointments by messaging me directly on Instagram. We’ll begin by discussing your ideas and customizing a design that fits your personal style and story. We'll then schedule an appointment, and a non-refundable deposit will be required to secure your spot.
      </p>
      
      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>
        My mission is to create awesome, customized designs that resonate with my clients and tell their unique stories. Whether it’s your first tattoo or your next piece, I’m here to bring your vision to life with professionalism and creativity.
